# Understanding Linear Regression

Linear regression is a foundational statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression involves a single independent variable and a dependent variable. The goal is to find the linear relationship between these two variables.

### The Formula

The formula for a simple linear regression line is \(y = mx + c\), where:

- \(y\) is the dependent variable,
- \(x\) is the independent variable,
- \(m\) is the slope of the line,
- \(c\) is the y-intercept.

### Example in Python

Below is a simple Python example using `matplotlib` and `numpy` to perform and plot a linear regression.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample data
x = np.array([5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55]).reshape((-1, 1))
y = np.array([5, 20, 14, 32, 22, 38])

# Linear regression
model = LinearRegression().fit(x, y)

# Making predictions
x_pred = np.linspace(5, 55, 100).reshape((-1, 1))
y_pred = model.predict(x_pred)

# Plotting
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue', label='Data points')
plt.plot(x_pred, y_pred, color='red', label='Regression line')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.title('Simple Linear Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
